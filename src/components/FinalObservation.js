                        National debates and legislative trends, as well as data on administration
                        of the death penalty in this Report, indicate that the issue of sexual
                        violence against women and children is now at the heart of the debate on
                        capital punishment in India. The rampancy and impunity of sexual violence
                        and the fractures within the criminal justice system perpetuating this
                        cycle, have led to a public outcry for harsher punishments.{' '}

                        The President of India, Mr. Ram Nath Kovind, weighed in on this debate and
                        opined that persons accused of rape and murder of minors should not file
                        mercy petitions for remission of sentences. In response to the outrage
                        following a brutal gangrape and murder in Hyderabad, the state legislature
                        of Andhra Pradesh amended the Indian Penal Code, 1860 to introduce the death
                        penalty for rape. This Bill also prescribes completing investigation and
                        trial of cases involving sexual violence in 21 days. This overall trend is
                        evident from the high proportion of death sentences imposed in cases of
                        murder involving sexual offences this year, the highest in four years and
                        with the highest number of confirmations by the High Courts in four years,
                        with a majority in offences of murder involving sexual offences.{' '}

                        The Supreme Court listed and heard the maximum number of capital cases (27)
                        since 2001. In 17 of these cases, the death sentence was commuted to life
                        imprisonment, out of which 11 were cases of murder involving sexual offence
                        and 10 where the victim was a minor. While the Andhra Pradesh Bill
                        accelerates the process of the trial; a few weeks after the Bill was passed,
                        the Supreme Court remitted a case of murder involving sexual offence of a
                        minor to the trial court, where the trial had been completed in only 13
                        days. With the focus of the public and the legislature on using the criminal
                        law in response to deep seated societal issues, such empirical work becomes
                        all the more essential. It is necessary that we engage in reform on the
                        basis of accurate and
